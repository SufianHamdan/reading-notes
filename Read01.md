# HTML

### Structure

#### How the Web Works

When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. 
In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

1. When you connect to the web, you do so via an Internet Service Provider (ISP). You type a domain name or web address
into your browser to visit a site; for example: 
google.com, bbc.co.uk, microsoft.com.

2. Your computer contacts a network of servers called Domain Name System (DNS) servers. These act like phone books; they tell your computer the IP address associated with the requested domain name.
An IP address is a number of up to 12 digits separated by periods / full stops. Every device connected to the web has a unique IP address; it is like the phone number for that computer.

3. The unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you
requested. A web server is a computer that is constantly connected to the web, and is set up especially to send web pages to users.

4. The web server then sends the page you requested back to your
web browser.

* HTML pages are text documents.

* HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.

* Tags are often referred to as elements.

* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.

* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.

* Attributes require a name and a value.

* To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

### Extra Markup

* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.

* You can add comments to your code between the `<!-- and -->` markers.

* The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.

* The `<div>` and `<span>` elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.

* `<iframes>` cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
* The `<meta>` tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
* Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as `<`, `>`, and `Â©`.

### HTML5 Layout

* The new HTML5 elements i XX ndicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.

* The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple `<div>` elements).

* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.

* To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.

### Process & Design

* It's important to understand w XX ho your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.

* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.

* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.

* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

* You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.

* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.

# Javascript

### Introduction

Javascript allows you to make web pages more interactive by accissing and modifying the content and markup used in a web page while its being viewed on the browser.

1.  ACCESS CONTENT

You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page. For example:

* Select the text inside all of the `<hl>` elements on a page
* Select any elements that have a class attribute with a value of note
* Find out what was entered into a text input whose id attribute has a value of email

2. MODIFY CONTENT

You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. For example:

* Add a paragraph of text after the first `<hl>` element
* Change the value of class attributes to trigger new CSS rules for those elements
* Change the size or position of an `<img>` element

3. PROGRAM RULES

You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page. For example:
 
* A gallery script could check which image a user clicked on and display a larger version of that image.
* A mortgage calculator could collect values from a fo rm, perform a calculation, and display repayments.
* An animation could check the dimensions of the browser window and move an image to the bottom
of the viewable area (also known as the viewport).

4. REACT TO EVENTS

You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred. For example, it could be run when:

* A button is pressed
* A link is clicked (or tapped) on
* A cursor hovers over an element
* Information is added to a form
* An interval of time has passed
* A web page has finished loading

### The ABC of Programming

* It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the .js extension.

* The HTML `<script>` element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the `<link>` element can be used to load a CSS file).

* If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,
because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.
